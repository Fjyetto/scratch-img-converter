# scratch-img-converter
this converts images into a grayscale list of values to use in [my project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/658510017/)

you will need:
- python
- pillow library for python

# how do i even use this
ok so first you put the python script in the same folder as your image
then you open the file in IDLE,
you edit the last line with "name" and change name to whatever your image file is named
and then you run the script in IDLE

if you are experienced with python you can probably find a way to use this without IDLE
